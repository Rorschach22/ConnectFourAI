We first attempted to implement the Connect Four AI through the GPU using clojure and jcuda. This failed horribly so we lowered our expectations and attempted to implement our own version of the algorithm in clojure using the GUI Ryan and Thomas made this last summer. Our implementation of the algorithm was not as easy as we had hoped so we scrapped this idea also and found a working solution of the Connect Four AI using a bit board in clojure. We instead decided to parallelize this linear implementation of the minimax algorithm for the Connect Four AI. Our results of the linearization of the minimax algorithm can be found in testResults.txt.
