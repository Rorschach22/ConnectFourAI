all cores kicked off to around 100%, it was moving really fast but then all of the sudden we hit an out of memory error pretty quickly.
increased memory
actually slower than make-move

completely slows it down, waited 2 and a half mintutes and 1 play still had not happened. It finishes on lower things

Mainly due to time restrictions because of our failures, we really only got into the pmap and never really got into promises or futures. Historically these are more difficult to implement. I don't recall there being a huge time increase using them either. Our understanding of the minimax algorithm also hinders our ability to implement futures and promises.
